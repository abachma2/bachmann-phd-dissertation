    \section{Introduction}
    Fuel cycle modeling has become an important part of understanding 
    transition scenarios. It entails modeling the flow of materials 
    from one fuel cycle facility to another, and the deployment of 
    facilities to meet the demands of the scenario modeled, such as
    reactors to meet a power demand or enrichment facilities to meet 
    the fuel demand of the reactors. To help address the 
    variety of applications 
    of fuel cycle models, multiple fuel cycle mdeling programs have 
    been developed. 

    This work discusses and compares some of the fuel cycle simulation 
    software that has been developed. The fuel cycle simulators 
    discussed in this work are not a comprehensive list of all available 
    simulators. 
    

    \section{Review}
    
    
    \subsection{DYMOND}
    The \gls{DYMOND} is the primary 
    system dynamics model used by AFCI to evaluate fuel cycle scenarios of 
    advanced nuclear energy systems \cite{yacout_visionverifiable_2006}.
    It is run using the \textit{iThink} software with Microsoft Excel 
    templates as the software inputs and outputs \cite{feng_standardized_2016}.
    Inputs to DYMOND include reactor and fuel characteristics, fuel cycle
    facilities, possible material flow pathways, and the power demand of the 
    scenario \cite{feng_standardized_2016}. 
    \gls{DYMOND} utilizes recipes to define reactor fuel inputs and outputs 
    \cite{yacout_visionverifiable_2006}. Current recipes available are limited 
    to specific reactor designs and burnups \cite{yacout_visionverifiable_2006}.

    \subsection{VISION}
    \Ac{VISION} was developed as part 
    of the the U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative 
    (AFCI) to help meet the initiative's objectives 
    \cite{yacout_visionverifiable_2006}. VISION was developed to 
    calculate the quantitative metrics to meet the explicit goals of the 
    AFCI. VISION calculates metrics to describe the characteristics and 
    consequences of the modeled fuel cycle. These metrics are grouped by the 
    AFCI program objectives and include waste management, proliferation 
    resistance, energy recovery, safety, and economics 
    \cite{yacout_visionverifiable_2006}. VISION is designed to simualte the 
    entire fuel cycle, but it is not designed to manage the fuel cycle, such 
    as tracking individual fuel assemblies \cite{yacout_visionverifiable_2006}.

    VISION is comprised of multiple modules that evaluate each mass flow and 
    metric \cite{yacout_visionverifiable_2006}. VISION doesn't do direct 
    neutronics calculations, it uses parameters output from external 
    neutronics calculations \cite{yacout_visionverifiable_2006}. To account 
    for changes in isotopic concentration (especially the short-lived 
    isotopes) VISION includes isotopic decay modeling. This assists in 
    understanding the waste forms in the fuel cycle \cite{yacout_visionverifiable_2006}.

    Economics modeling is implemented to closely match the AFCI Cost Basis 
    Report \cite{yacout_visionverifiable_2006}. 

    Potential uses of \gls{VISION} include investigating the timing issues 
    associated with reactor deployment or waste accumulation for reprocessing, 
    or evaluating the benefits of advanced fuel cycles to meet specific 
    criteria, such as the storage limits of a geologic repository 
    \cite{yacout_visionverifiable_2006}. 

    Can provide time-dependent analysis, as shown in \cite{piet_dynamic_2011}, 
    which simulated the transition from LWRs to advanced reactors with different 
    forms of recycling. 

    Models continuous reprocessing of fuel at every time step, same as DYMOND \cite{feng_standardized_2016}.



    \subsection{Cyclus}
    open source agent-based fuel cycle simulator. Built 
    in C++, \Cyclus uses only open source and freely available libraries to 
    provide full access to all users and developers. The 
    \Cyclus architecture treats materials and facilities discretely and allows 
    for variable fidelity levels \cite{huff_fundamental_2016}. These attributes
    of \Cyclus allow for the software to easily model any fuel cycle scenario.

    Similar to VISION, \Cyclus can also do economics modeling. 

    

    \subsection{ORION}
    ORION is a fuel cycle simulator developed by the UK National Nuclear 
    Laboratory to track material movement through a user-defined nuclear 
    fuel cycle, model decay of radionuclides, and model transmutation of fuel
    \cite{gregg_analysis_2012}. The modeling is accurate enough to provide 
    high-fidelity radioactive decay and tracking of over 2000 radionuclides
    \cite{feng_standardized_2016}. 
    
    ORION has the ability to model each facility 
    as individual objects, which can be grouped together to represent small-scale 
    facilities. Can automate facility deployment to meet electricity demand
    \cite{feng_standardized_2016}, simialar to what has been developed through 
    the \Cycamore archetypes for \Cyclus \cite{scopatz_cyclus_2015}.  

    ORION can also simulate in-core irradiation of fuel, uisng externally 
    generated lattice physics calculations prior to the ORION analysis
    \cite{feng_standardized_2016}. This is different from \Cyclus, 
    DYMOND, and VISION, which all use defined recipes for fuel before 
    and after the reactor. 

    ORION has been used to evaluate the transition from the current fleet of 
    Light Water Reactors in the U.S. to a fleet of sodium fast reactors with 
    continuius recycling \cite{sunny_transition_2015}.

    Explicitly models the timing of each fuel reload in between cycle lengths 
    instead of averaging the mass flow over a time step (which 
    is what DYMOND and VISION do)\cite{feng_standardized_2016}.


    
    \subsection{Comparison}
    There was a multi-lab effort to compare the above mentioned fuel cycle 
    simulators. Each national lab in the project used a different 
    fuel cycle simulator: \gls{ORNL} used ORION, \gls{INL} used 
    \gls{VISION}, \gls{ANL} used \gls{DYMOND}, and \gls{LLNL} used
    \Cyclus. Each lab simulated the same transition from a once-through 
    fuel cycle to one with continuous recyling of uranium and plutonium 
    with natural uranium in a fleet of critial fast reactors. This 
    fuel cycle option was identified as a scenario of interest in the 
    \gls{DOE-NE} Evaluation \& Screening Report \cite{wigeland_nuclear_2014}.
    
    Results from \Cyclus are in \cite{djokic_application_2015}


    \subsubsection{Verification}

    Verification of fuel cycle models has been performed
    \cite{feng_standardized_2016,bae_standardized_2019}. Verification efforts
    compared the performance of DYMOND, VISION, ORION, MARKAL 
    \cite{feng_standardized_2016} and \Cyclus later \cite{bae_standardized_2019}, 
    making adjustments to the codes as needed
    during the verification to ensure agreement between the codes. Verification 
    of each code used the same problem description: the transition from 
    a fleet of 100 \glspl{LWR} to \glspl{SFR} with reprocessing assuming a
    0\% energy demand growth.  
    The scenario was designed to be simple enough to allow for a comparison 
    to be made with results from a spreadsheet using basic arithmetic. The 
    results of this 
    verification showed that each of the codes and the spreadsheet were in 
    good agreement, with the exception of a few differences resulting from 
    variations in the code functions \cite{feng_standardized_2016}.

    The verification of \Cyclus identified two primary differences between 
    this code and the others verified \cite{bae_standardized_2019}. The 
    first is the core depletion upon reactor decommissioning. The \Cycamore
    reactor archetype deplets half of the core upon decommissioning, while the 
    other codes deplete the entire core. This difference was mitigated by 
    modifying the \Cycamore source code to match the other codes. The other 
    difference identified is that \Cyclus and ORION both fully resolve 
    discrete batches of fuel discharge, while the other codes do not. This 
    difference stems from modeling choices made in each of the codes
