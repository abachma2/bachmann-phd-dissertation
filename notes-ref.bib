	abstract = {This chapter explains isotopes of uranium and how they are separated in processes to provide the enriched uranium required to make fuel for civil nuclear power stations across the globe. Commercial, industrial-scale enrichment facilities operating in the world today are detailed, together with a brief overview of historic processes and potential future technologies. Demand for uranium enrichment services is discussed compared to supply and key factors that influence the balance are reviewed. Quality control in uranium enrichment processes and the management of depleted tails arising are covered, together with experience enriching reprocessed uranium.},
