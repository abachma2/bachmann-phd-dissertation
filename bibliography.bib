	abstract = {The C YCLUS Fuel Cycle Simulator [1] is a framework
for assessment of nuclear fuel cycle options. While C Y -
CLUS has previously been capable of system transitions
from the current fuel cycle strategy to a future option, those
transitions have never previously been driven by market
forces in the simulation. This summary describes a set
of libraries [2] that have been contibuted to the C YCLUS
framework to enable a market-driven transition analysis.
This simulation framework is incomplete without a suite
of dynamically loadable libraries representing the process
physics of the nuclear fuel cycle (i.e. mining, fuel fabri-
cation, chemical processing, transmutation, reprocessing,
etc.). Within Cycamore [3], the additional modules reposi-
tory within the C YCLUS ecosystem, provides some basic li-
braries to represent these processes. However, extension of
C YCLUS with new capabilities is community-driven, rely-
ing on contributions by user-developers. The libraries con-
tributed in this work are examples of such contributions.},

	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {A nuclear fuel cycle systems modeling and code-to-code comparison effort was coordinated across multiple national laboratories to verify the tools needed to perform fuel cycle analyses of the transition from a once-through nuclear fuel cycle to a sustainable potential future fuel cycle. For this verification study, a simplified example transition scenario was developed to serve as a test case for the four systems codes involved (DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL), each used by a different laboratory participant. In addition, all participants produced spreadsheet solutions for the test case to check all the mass flows and reactor/facility profiles on a year-by-year basis throughout the simulation period. The test case specifications describe a transition from the current US fleet of light water reactors to a future fleet of sodium-cooled fast reactors that continuously recycle transuranic elements as fuel. After several initial coordinated modeling and calculation attempts, it was revealed that most of the differences in code results were not due to different code algorithms or calculation approaches, but due to different interpretations of the input specifications among the analysts. Therefore, the specifications for the test case itself were iteratively updated to remove ambiguity and to help calibrate interpretations. In addition, a few corrections and modifications were made to the codes as well, which led to excellent agreement between all codes and spreadsheets for this test case. Although no fuel cycle transition analysis codes matched the spreadsheet results exactly, all remaining differences in the results were due to fundamental differences in code structure and/or were thoroughly explained. The specifications and example results are provided so that they can be used to verify additional codes in the future for such fuel cycle transition scenarios.},

	abstract = {Many nuclear fuel cycle simulators can analyze transitions from once-through to advanced nuclear fuel cycles. Verification studies compare various fuel cycle analysis tools to test agreement and identify sources of difference. A recent verification study, Feng et al. (2016) established transition scenario test case specifications and accordingly evaluated national laboratory nuclear fuel cycle simulators, DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL. This work verifies the performance of Cyclus, the agent-based, open-source fuel cycle simulator, using the test case specifications in Feng et. al. In this work, Cyclus demonstrates agreement with the results from the previous verification study. Minor differences reflect intentional, detailed material tracking in the Cycamore reactor module. These results extend the example results in Feng et al. to further enable future verification of additional nuclear fuel cycle simulation tools.},
