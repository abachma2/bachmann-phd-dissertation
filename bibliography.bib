	abstract = {Simulation of the nuclear fuel cycle can be performed using a wide range of techniques and methodologies. Past efforts have focused on specific fuel cycles or reactor technologies. The CYCLUS fuel cycle simulator seeks to separate the design of the simulation from the fuel cycle or technologies of interest. In order to support this separation, a robust supply–demand communication and solution framework is required. Accordingly an agent-based supply-chain framework, the Dynamic Resource Exchange (DRE), has been designed implemented in CYCLUS. It supports the communication of complex resources, namely isotopic compositions of nuclear fuel, between fuel cycle facilities and their managers (e.g., institutions and regions). Instances of supply and demand are defined as an optimization problem and solved for each timestep. Importantly, the DRE allows each agent in the simulation to independently indicate preference for specific trading options in order to meet both physics requirements and satisfy constraints imposed by potential socio-political models. To display the variety of possible simulations that the DRE enables, example scenarios are formulated and described. Important features include key fuel-cycle facility outages, introduction of external recycled fuel sources (similar to the current mixed oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication facility in the United States), and nontrivial interactions between fuel cycles existing in different regions.},

As with all simulation tools, fuel cycle simulators require verification through unit tests, benchmark cases, and integral tests. Model validation is a vital aspect, as well. Although comparative studies have been performed, there is no comprehensive unit test and benchmark library for fuel cycle simulator tools. The objective of this paper is to identify some of the “must test” functionalities of a fuel cycle simulator tool within the context of specific problems of interest to the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign within the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy (DOE-NE). This paper identifies the features needed to cover the range of promising fuel cycle options identified in the DOE-NE Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening and categorizes these features to facilitate prioritization. Features are categorized as essential functions, integrating features, and exemplary capabilities. A library of unit tests applicable to each of the essential functions should be developed as future work. An international dialog on the functionalities and standard test methods for fuel cycle simulator tools is encouraged.},

	abstract = {In support of the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign implemented by the US Department of
Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy, thermal and fast spectrum molten salt reactors (MSRs) were
analyzed to assess performance of the reactor technology in various fuel cycles. These analyses
include fuel cycles with (1) continuous recycle of U/Pu with new natural uranium fuel in fast
critical reactors, (2) continuous recycle of U/Pu with new natural uranium fuel in both fast and
thermal critical reactors, and (3) limited and continuous recycle of 233U/Th in thermal reactors.
For each analysis, the evolution of the fuel salt was simulated for several years, and the fuel cycle
metrics were calculated at the end of the simulation after equilibrium was achieved. Both thermal
and fast spectrum MSRs performed well in replacing other technologies. Fuel cycle metrics
highlight the impact of larger mass flow rates in MSRs due to their continuous treatment and
separations of the fuel salt material. Liquid-fueled MSRs also provide a benefit in transition due to
immediate availability of bred fissile material and low out-of-core time. Results from these
analyses provide confidence that MSR technologies achieve adequate neutronic performance and
may be used as an alternate reactor technology in the studied fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {A nuclear fuel cycle systems modeling and code-to-code comparison effort was coordinated across multiple national laboratories to verify the tools needed to perform fuel cycle analyses of the transition from a once-through nuclear fuel cycle to a sustainable potential future fuel cycle. For this verification study, a simplified example transition scenario was developed to serve as a test case for the four systems codes involved (DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL), each used by a different laboratory participant. In addition, all participants produced spreadsheet solutions for the test case to check all the mass flows and reactor/facility profiles on a year-by-year basis throughout the simulation period. The test case specifications describe a transition from the current US fleet of light water reactors to a future fleet of sodium-cooled fast reactors that continuously recycle transuranic elements as fuel. After several initial coordinated modeling and calculation attempts, it was revealed that most of the differences in code results were not due to different code algorithms or calculation approaches, but due to different interpretations of the input specifications among the analysts. Therefore, the specifications for the test case itself were iteratively updated to remove ambiguity and to help calibrate interpretations. In addition, a few corrections and modifications were made to the codes as well, which led to excellent agreement between all codes and spreadsheets for this test case. Although no fuel cycle transition analysis codes matched the spreadsheet results exactly, all remaining differences in the results were due to fundamental differences in code structure and/or were thoroughly explained. The specifications and example results are provided so that they can be used to verify additional codes in the future for such fuel cycle transition scenarios.},

The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation.

	abstract = {The driving forces in the development of SMRs are their specific characteristics. They can be deployed
incrementally to closely match increasing energy demand resulting in a moderate financial commitment for
countries or regions with smaller electricity grids. SMRs show the promise of significant cost reduction
through modularization and factory construction which should further improve the construction schedule and
reduce costs. In the area of wider applicability SMR designs and sizes are better suited for partial or
dedicated use in non-electrical applications such as providing heat for industrial processes, hydrogen
production or sea-water desalination. Process heat or cogeneration results in significantly improved thermal
efficiencies leading to a better return on investment. Some SMR designs may also serve niche markets, for
example to burn nuclear waste.
Booklets on the status of SMR technology developments have been published in 2012, 2014 and 2016. The
objective is to provide Member States with a concise overview of the latest status of SMR designs. This
booklet is reporting the advances in design and technology developments of SMRs of all the major
technology lines within the category of SMRs. It covers land based and marine based water-cooled reactors,
high temperature gas cooled reactors, liquid metal, sodium and gas-cooled fast neutron spectrum reactors and
molten salt reactors. The content on the specific SMRs is provided by the responsible institute or

	abstract = {The present U.S. nuclear fuel cycle faces challenges that hinder the expansion of nuclear energy technology. The U.S. Department of Energy identified four nuclear fuel cycle options that make nuclear energy technology more desirable. Successfully analyzing the transitions from the current fuel cycle to these promising fuel cycles requires a nuclear fuel cycle simulator that can predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This work introduces and demonstrates the demand-driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, an open-source nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework. User-controlled capabilities such as time-series forecasting algorithms, supply buffers, and facility preferences were introduced to give users tools to minimize power undersupply in a transition scenario simulation. The demand-driven deployment capabilities are referred to as d3ploy. We demonstrate the capability of d3ploy to predict future commodities’ supply and demand, and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet the predicted demand in four transition scenarios. Using d3ploy to set up transition scenarios saves the user simulation setup time compared to previous efforts that required a user to manually calculate and use trial and error to set up the deployment scheme for the supporting fuel cycle facilities.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in nuclear fuel materials research, particularly on the topic of accident-tolerant fuels, have brought up potential opportunities for expanding the operating envelope of existing light water reactors. As many of the performance improvements offered by these technologies may be most fully realized by increasing fuel enrichment beyond the standard 5\% limit, this paper examines the potential reactor performance and fuel cycle performance of low-enriched uranium oxide fueled light water reactors by generically considering pressurized water reactors with 235U enrichment from 5 to 7\%. Advanced cladding, including accident-tolerant cladding, has the potential to increase fuel burnup limits related to hydrogen in the cladding that coincide with those limits associated with end-of-life reactivity. Therefore, higher enrichment will be necessary in order to realize the higher fuel burnups. This work includes evaluation of the fuel cycle length, discharge burnup, reactivity coefficients, and fuel cycle performance, including radioactive waste and environmental impact metrics per unit energy generated. The analysis was performed using the evaluation metrics from the US Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening Study. The reactor performance and safety analysis show that enrichments between 5 and 7\% would have similar fuel temperature and moderator temperature coefficients. However, the soluble boron coefficient would decrease in magnitude, requiring more corrosive boric acid in the coolant or other methods of reactivity control during the fuel cycle. At these higher enrichments the maximum burnup at the rim of the fuel pellet would increase by almost a factor of two, which is expected to impact the formation of high-burnup structure in the fuel and the corresponding thermo-mechanical fuel properties. The fuel cycle performance assessment shows that increasing enrichment reduces the quantity of high-level waste disposed per unit energy generated, but it increases the natural resource requirements normalized to a gigawatt-electricity-per-year basis. Another impact is the slightly higher discharge burnup, resulting in somewhat different activity levels of the spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste radioactivity at 100 and 100,000 years after fuel discharge. The environmental impacts—including land use, water use, carbon emission, and radiological exposure—are of the same magnitude per unit energy generated. However, the impacts are distributed differently. Less than 5\% enrichment has marginally more impact on the back-end of the fuel cycle, and greater than 5\% enrichment has marginally more impact on the front-end of the fuel cycle. Ultimately, no neutronic or reactor safety hindrances to employing light water reactor fuel with enrichments greater than 5\% are identified; given the achievable reactor performance benefits with advanced fuels, further practical exploration of increased enrichment fuel is recommended.},

	abstract = {We examine the potential fuel cycle performance of high assay low-enriched uranium fueled small light water reactors by considering several floating small reactor concepts of Russian origin with 235U enrichment at 10\%, 15\%, and 19.7\%. These enrichments are generic but representative of the reactor concepts being considered. The small reactor concepts were considered parametrically at two different power densities and neutron leakage fractions. The analysis was performed for the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy using the evaluation metrics from the Evaluation and Screening (E\&S) Study. The reference reactor system in a once-through fuel cycle with an enrichment greater than 5\%, but less than 20\%, in the E\&S study is a graphite-moderated modular high temperature gas-cooled reactor (mHTGR). The neutron spectrum of an mHTGR is very different from these Russian floating small reactor concepts, which is why this analysis was conducted. The fuel cycle analysis indicates that increasing core leakage negatively impacts the natural resource requirements as well as the spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste radioactivity normalized to a giga-watt electric year (GWe-yr) basis. Further, we found that the 235U enrichment of the fuel and the rated core power density have limited fuel cycle performance impacts. One impact is the slightly higher discharge burnup of the de-rated power cases resulting in different spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste radioactivity at 100 and 100,000 years after fuel discharge. The most significant result from the study is the observation that all the enrichment and power density cases resulted in decreased radioactivity at 100,000 years relative to the reference mHTGR example case with 15.5\%-enrichment from the E\&S study.},

	abstract = {The US Department of Energy Office of Fuel Cycle Technologies performed an evaluation and screening (E\&S) study of nuclear fuel cycle options to help prioritize future research and development decisions. Previous work for this E\&S study focused on establishing equilibrium conditionsfor analysis examples of40 nuclearfuel cycle evaluation groups (EGs) and evaluating their performance according to a set of 22 standardized metrics. Following the E\&S study, additional studies are being conducted to assess transitioningfrom the current USfuel cycle to future fuel cycle options identified by the E\&S study as being most promising. These studies help inform decisions on how to effectively achieve full transition, estimate the length of time needed to undergo transition from the current fuel cycle, and evaluate performance of nuclear systems and facilities in place during the transition. These studies also help identify any barriers to achieve transition. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Fuel Cycle Options Campaign team used ORION to analyze the transition pathway from the existing US nuclear fuel cycle—the once-through use of low-enriched-uranium (LEU) fuel in thermal-spectrum light water reactors (LWRs) —to a new fuel cycle with continuous recycling ofplutonium and uranium in sodium fast reactors (SFRs). This paper discusses the analysis of the transition from an LWR to an SFR fleet using ORION, highlights the role of lifetime extensions of existing LWRs to aid transition, and discusses how a slight delay in SFR deployment can actually reduce the time to achieve an equilibrium fuel cycle.},

	abstract = {Since the construction of the first commercial nuclear power plant in 1957, the nuclear power industry has operated under the philosophy of economy of scale - the idea that increased power plant size accounts for higher economic efficiency. However, there has been a recent shift in direction; small modular reactors (SMRs) and micro-reactors are being considered as potentially wise investments for commercial power producers in that they can provide advantages that large-scale reactors may not possess in terms of reactor safety and investment risk. However, this may come at the risk of a higher levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). LCOE may be reduced by enriching the fuel passed its regulated limit of 5 wt\% (w/o) 235U. The high assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel (5–20 w/o 235U) is introduced to increase the plant capacity factor, which thereby decrease fuel supply costs and reduce the LCOE. While decreasing plant LCOE seems like a clear advantage, several issues may result from increasing enrichments to the HALEU level in an SMR or micro-reactor design. This paper aims to shed light on these issues and address how they may affect the overall reactor design by using HALEU fuels in these reactors. This paper first discusses the notable effects on a reactor design with higher enrichment, then analyzes a SMR case study based on the NuScale’s 160 MWth SMR design. The case study reveals that the SMR with higher enriched fuel was able to double both fuel burnup and cycle time with an average core enrichment of 8.34 w/o and a maximum average assembly enrichment of 9.10 w/o. Moreover, this higher enriched core was found to operate with a maximum global peaking factor of 1.86, well below the published limit of 2.0. Likewise, the maximum axial flux offset of −2.4\% and the maximum boron concentration of 1757 ppm both remain within their respective safety constraints. Notable fission poisons, such as 149Sm and 135Xe, were also found to sharply increase in the HALEU core. Additionally, the average fuel temperature and peak cladding temperature fell within their respective safety constraints. Core-averaged flux, fluence, cladding creep, and post-shutdown decay heat were also investigated. Lastly, the higher enriched core was found to reduce LCOE by approximately 1.23 \$/MWh.},

	abstract = {Small modular reactors (SMRs) are currently being considered as future investments for commercial entities due to perceived advantages over traditional large-scale power reactors, particularly their considerably lower capital costs. One strategy for lowering the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of SMRs is to increase their burnup by utilizing high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuels, which range from 5 to 20 weight percent (w/o) of U-235. By increasing fuel enrichment to HALEU levels, with higher specific fuel costs compared to standard enrichment, a plant may achieve an increased capacity factor by extending its fuel cycle and thereby reducing average yearly fuel supply costs. It is expected that the benefits of optimizing fuel enrichment to extend a reactor’s fuel cycle outweigh the added cost due to more expensive fuel. In this paper, the net benefit of extending an SMR’s fuel cycle by enriching uranium fuel to HALEU levels was estimated using 2017 nuclear fuel production market data with NuScale’s 160 MWt SMR design as a case study. It was found that, for NuScale’s design, plant LCOE decreased with increasing cycle length enabled by higher fuel enrichment. It was also observed that doubling cycle time from 24 months to 48 months netted each reactor a 1.23 \$/MWh reduction in LCOE. The total savings for a 12-module SMR design were estimated to be around \$5,840,000 per year. Therefore, utilizing HALEU fuel in SMRs can vastly improve their economic efficiency.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) full-core calculations are an integral part of fuel reload design for today’s light water reactors (LWRs). The current approaches are typically based on the nodal diffusion codes that calculate criticality state points and power distributions as a function of burnup. The CASL VERA (Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors, Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications) code represents one of the latest advancements in 3D full-core calculation analysis based on transport theory methods employing the Method of Characteristics (MOC) and coupled multi-physics. In this article, a publicly released version of the NuScale reactor core is analysed with the VERA code (version 3.9 and 4.1) and contrasted against some static Serpent and Polaris based simulations. The analysis shows an excellent agreement for the lattice-level calculations as well as with some of the 3D full-core models. However, larger deviations were found in cases with heavy reflector models, whereby the reflector composition was found to impact the differences between the VERA and Serpent results. In this analysis, it was determined that greater than 90\% stainless steel content in the heavy reflector leads to higher deviations between the VERA results and the Serpent results. The burnup calculations showed that the presence of the heavy reflector extends the cycle length and also leads to a flatter power distribution in the core, which can generally be interpreted as more efficient.},
