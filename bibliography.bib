	abstract = {Simulation of the nuclear fuel cycle can be performed using a wide range of techniques and methodologies. Past efforts have focused on specific fuel cycles or reactor technologies. The CYCLUS fuel cycle simulator seeks to separate the design of the simulation from the fuel cycle or technologies of interest. In order to support this separation, a robust supply–demand communication and solution framework is required. Accordingly an agent-based supply-chain framework, the Dynamic Resource Exchange (DRE), has been designed implemented in CYCLUS. It supports the communication of complex resources, namely isotopic compositions of nuclear fuel, between fuel cycle facilities and their managers (e.g., institutions and regions). Instances of supply and demand are defined as an optimization problem and solved for each timestep. Importantly, the DRE allows each agent in the simulation to independently indicate preference for specific trading options in order to meet both physics requirements and satisfy constraints imposed by potential socio-political models. To display the variety of possible simulations that the DRE enables, example scenarios are formulated and described. Important features include key fuel-cycle facility outages, introduction of external recycled fuel sources (similar to the current mixed oxide (MOX) fuel fabrication facility in the United States), and nontrivial interactions between fuel cycles existing in different regions.},

	abstract = {A nuclear fuel cycle systems modeling and code-to-code comparison effort was coordinated across multiple national laboratories to verify the tools needed to perform fuel cycle analyses of the transition from a once-through nuclear fuel cycle to a sustainable potential future fuel cycle. For this verification study, a simplified example transition scenario was developed to serve as a test case for the four systems codes involved (DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL), each used by a different laboratory participant. In addition, all participants produced spreadsheet solutions for the test case to check all the mass flows and reactor/facility profiles on a year-by-year basis throughout the simulation period. The test case specifications describe a transition from the current US fleet of light water reactors to a future fleet of sodium-cooled fast reactors that continuously recycle transuranic elements as fuel. After several initial coordinated modeling and calculation attempts, it was revealed that most of the differences in code results were not due to different code algorithms or calculation approaches, but due to different interpretations of the input specifications among the analysts. Therefore, the specifications for the test case itself were iteratively updated to remove ambiguity and to help calibrate interpretations. In addition, a few corrections and modifications were made to the codes as well, which led to excellent agreement between all codes and spreadsheets for this test case. Although no fuel cycle transition analysis codes matched the spreadsheet results exactly, all remaining differences in the results were due to fundamental differences in code structure and/or were thoroughly explained. The specifications and example results are provided so that they can be used to verify additional codes in the future for such fuel cycle transition scenarios.},

Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

incrementally to closely match increasing energy demand resulting in a moderate financial commitment for
countries or regions with smaller electricity grids. SMRs show the promise of significant cost reduction
through modularization and factory construction which should further improve the construction schedule and
reduce costs. In the area of wider applicability SMR designs and sizes are better suited for partial or
dedicated use in non-electrical applications such as providing heat for industrial processes, hydrogen
production or sea-water desalination. Process heat or cogeneration results in significantly improved thermal
efficiencies leading to a better return on investment. Some SMR designs may also serve niche markets, for
example to burn nuclear waste.
Booklets on the status of SMR technology developments have been published in 2012, 2014 and 2016. The
objective is to provide Member States with a concise overview of the latest status of SMR designs. This
booklet is reporting the advances in design and technology developments of SMRs of all the major
technology lines within the category of SMRs. It covers land based and marine based water-cooled reactors,
high temperature gas cooled reactors, liquid metal, sodium and gas-cooled fast neutron spectrum reactors and
molten salt reactors. The content on the specific SMRs is provided by the responsible institute or

The U.S. Department of Energy identified four nuclear fuel cycle options that make nuclear energy technology more desirable. Successfully analyzing the transitions from the current fuel cycle to these promising fuel cycles requires a nuclear fuel cycle simulator that can predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This work introduces and demonstrates the demand-driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, an open-source nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework. User-controlled capabilities such as time-series forecasting algorithms, supply buffers, and facility preferences were introduced to give users tools to minimize power undersupply in a transition scenario simulation. The demand-driven deployment capabilities are referred to as d3ploy. We demonstrate the capability of d3ploy to predict future commodities’ supply and demand, and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet the predicted demand in four transition scenarios. Using d3ploy to set up transition scenarios saves the user simulation setup time compared to previous efforts that required a user to manually calculate and use trial and error to set up the deployment scheme for the supporting fuel cycle facilities.},

	abstract = {The US Department of Energy Office of Fuel Cycle Technologies performed an evaluation and screening (E\&S) study of nuclear fuel cycle options to help prioritize future research and development decisions. Previous work for this E\&S study focused on establishing equilibrium conditionsfor analysis examples of40 nuclearfuel cycle evaluation groups (EGs) and evaluating their performance according to a set of 22 standardized metrics. Following the E\&S study, additional studies are being conducted to assess transitioningfrom the current USfuel cycle to future fuel cycle options identified by the E\&S study as being most promising. These studies help inform decisions on how to effectively achieve full transition, estimate the length of time needed to undergo transition from the current fuel cycle, and evaluate performance of nuclear systems and facilities in place during the transition. These studies also help identify any barriers to achieve transition. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Fuel Cycle Options Campaign team used ORION to analyze the transition pathway from the existing US nuclear fuel cycle—the once-through use of low-enriched-uranium (LEU) fuel in thermal-spectrum light water reactors (LWRs) —to a new fuel cycle with continuous recycling ofplutonium and uranium in sodium fast reactors (SFRs). This paper discusses the analysis of the transition from an LWR to an SFR fleet using ORION, highlights the role of lifetime extensions of existing LWRs to aid transition, and discusses how a slight delay in SFR deployment can actually reduce the time to achieve an equilibrium fuel cycle.},
