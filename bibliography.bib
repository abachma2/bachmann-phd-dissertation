	abstract = {Many nuclear fuel cycle simulators can analyze transitions from once-through to advanced nuclear fuel cycles. Verification studies compare various fuel cycle analysis tools to test agreement and identify sources of difference. A recent verification study, Feng et al. (2016) established transition scenario test case specifications and accordingly evaluated national laboratory nuclear fuel cycle simulators, DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL. This work verifies the performance of Cyclus, the agent-based, open-source fuel cycle simulator, using the test case specifications in Feng et. al. In this work, Cyclus demonstrates agreement with the results from the previous verification study. Minor differences reflect intentional, detailed material tracking in the Cycamore reactor module. These results extend the example results in Feng et al. to further enable future verification of additional nuclear fuel cycle simulation tools.},

	abstract = {A nuclear fuel cycle systems modeling and code-to-code comparison effort was coordinated across multiple national laboratories to verify the tools needed to perform fuel cycle analyses of the transition from a once-through nuclear fuel cycle to a sustainable potential future fuel cycle. For this verification study, a simplified example transition scenario was developed to serve as a test case for the four systems codes involved (DYMOND, VISION, ORION, and MARKAL), each used by a different laboratory participant. In addition, all participants produced spreadsheet solutions for the test case to check all the mass flows and reactor/facility profiles on a year-by-year basis throughout the simulation period. The test case specifications describe a transition from the current US fleet of light water reactors to a future fleet of sodium-cooled fast reactors that continuously recycle transuranic elements as fuel. After several initial coordinated modeling and calculation attempts, it was revealed that most of the differences in code results were not due to different code algorithms or calculation approaches, but due to different interpretations of the input specifications among the analysts. Therefore, the specifications for the test case itself were iteratively updated to remove ambiguity and to help calibrate interpretations. In addition, a few corrections and modifications were made to the codes as well, which led to excellent agreement between all codes and spreadsheets for this test case. Although no fuel cycle transition analysis codes matched the spreadsheet results exactly, all remaining differences in the results were due to fundamental differences in code structure and/or were thoroughly explained. The specifications and example results are provided so that they can be used to verify additional codes in the future for such fuel cycle transition scenarios.},

To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {The driving forces in the development of SMRs are their specific characteristics. They can be deployed
incrementally to closely match increasing energy demand resulting in a moderate financial commitment for
countries or regions with smaller electricity grids. SMRs show the promise of significant cost reduction
through modularization and factory construction which should further improve the construction schedule and
reduce costs. In the area of wider applicability SMR designs and sizes are better suited for partial or
dedicated use in non-electrical applications such as providing heat for industrial processes, hydrogen
production or sea-water desalination. Process heat or cogeneration results in significantly improved thermal
efficiencies leading to a better return on investment. Some SMR designs may also serve niche markets, for
example to burn nuclear waste.
Booklets on the status of SMR technology developments have been published in 2012, 2014 and 2016. The
objective is to provide Member States with a concise overview of the latest status of SMR designs. This
booklet is reporting the advances in design and technology developments of SMRs of all the major
technology lines within the category of SMRs. It covers land based and marine based water-cooled reactors,
high temperature gas cooled reactors, liquid metal, sodium and gas-cooled fast neutron spectrum reactors and
molten salt reactors. The content on the specific SMRs is provided by the responsible institute or
organization and is reproduced, with permission, in this booklet.},

	abstract = {The present U.S. nuclear fuel cycle faces challenges that hinder the expansion of nuclear energy technology. The U.S. Department of Energy identified four nuclear fuel cycle options that make nuclear energy technology more desirable. Successfully analyzing the transitions from the current fuel cycle to these promising fuel cycles requires a nuclear fuel cycle simulator that can predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This work introduces and demonstrates the demand-driven deployment capabilities in Cyclus, an open-source nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework. User-controlled capabilities such as time-series forecasting algorithms, supply buffers, and facility preferences were introduced to give users tools to minimize power undersupply in a transition scenario simulation. The demand-driven deployment capabilities are referred to as d3ploy. We demonstrate the capability of d3ploy to predict future commodities’ supply and demand, and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet the predicted demand in four transition scenarios. Using d3ploy to set up transition scenarios saves the user simulation setup time compared to previous efforts that required a user to manually calculate and use trial and error to set up the deployment scheme for the supporting fuel cycle facilities.},
